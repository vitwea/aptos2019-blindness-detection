\# APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection



This repository contains a simple, end-to-end solution for the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Kaggle competition.



The main goal is to practice a clean and reproducible workflow:

\- Local environment with virtualenv

\- Basic data pipeline (loading, preprocessing)

\- Simple baseline model for diabetic retinopathy detection

\- Version control with Git and GitHub



\## Project structure



\- `data/`: raw and processed data (not tracked in Git)

\- `notebooks/`: exploratory analysis and experiments

\- `src/`: reusable Python modules (data loading, preprocessing, training)



\## Dataset



The dataset comes from the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection competition on Kaggle.
